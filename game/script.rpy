label start:

z "That's the last of us, correct?"

z "I'm pretty sure! If I remember, it said 15 people on the invite, right?"

"It did? I only remember that there was a party. . ."

"I checked the invite card one more time, guess they were right, It does say 15. . ."

"I must’ve forgotten it when I was asleep, can’t blame me though, I was the first one here."

"Talking about sleeping. . . I might as well take another nap, it’ll take another hour to be there, and it's not like anyone would want to talk to me anyways."

"My sight faded into black as I soon drifted into sleep. . ."

#*Wait 5 seconds*

"I felt a tap on my shoulder, maybe I should correct that, I felt almost 100 taps on my shoulder every second."

z "H-hey Umm, are you awake? We’re here! At the p - party!"

"I slowly opened my eyes to see someone in front of me."

z "Oh we are? AWESOME! I was waiting for hours!"

z "You were only asleep for 20 minutes."

z "Don't ruin the fun, Let's just get to the party!"

"Oh, I have just noticed something, I was a little forgetful and forgot to introduce myself."

"I am Reno Bulgur, the Ultimate Actor."

"Everyone here is also an Ultimate. . . But I fell asleep so I didn’t catch their Ultimates."

"Oh, By the way, If your wondering. . . Ultimates are special talents people can have when you're the best of  the best at what you do. . . I don't know how I got mine thought, I just do what I do."

"Oh, And before I forget anything else, I should run to the party, I'm falling behind!"

#*Footsteps to show running, also Screen fades black*

#*Screen fades into the front of the mansion*

Re "Wow. . . This is bigger than my house!"

z "No shit, Nobody here lives in a mansion."

Re "Hey. . . Thats rude."

z "That's the point"

z "Come on! Forget the bad things and let's go in already!"

z " Mhm! Mhm! Forget the bad! Forget the bad! Let's just go in!"

"Ummm. . . he sure likes repeating himself. . . but both of them are right, we should forget the bad things and worries."

"I prepare myself to see the inside of this mansion, hyping myself, preparing myself to open the door"

z "Hey! Hey! I'm opening the door! Everyone! Come on!"

Re ". . . okay then"

"Everyone crowded around the door while the strange small boy opened it."

"The door opened, and when we all got in suddenly. . ."

"*THUD*"

"The person who woke me up before fainted right then and there. . . everyone did one by one. . ."

"I quickly covered my nose and mouth, I saw a strange gas fill the room, now I couldn’t see anymore, the strange gas covered my sight, All I could see is. . . a shadow in the gas."

"It looked like a girl with cat ears for some reason. She uncovered my nose and I soon fainted into darkness."

#-Shows opening for prolog-

"I wake up to be in some kind of fancy living room, . . what happened. . . I can't remember anything. . ."

"I look where I am, Im. . . on the floor next to the couch. . . Geez, I must’ve fallen off again."

"I get up to look around, Just in case if someone else was here."

Re "Hello? Is. . . Anyone here?"

"I can barely see anything, wonder why, My eyes have never been this bad before."

"I can see a figure, I can't hear anything, I can't smell anything either . . . Did I get really drunk or something?"

"It does make sense if I can't remember anything then. . . And it's a party too, right?"

"I rub my eyes to see if I can fix my eyes or not. . . it doesn’t work though."

"I walk up to the figure to see if I can see them better, I can see them sightly, but I don’t think it's any good just knowing they are female."

"I think I’m also getting my senses back, I can sightly hear something."

z "Hey you alright, can you hear me?"

Re ". . . slightly, are you also having issues with your senses?"

z "yeah . . ."

Re " So i'm not drunk? Okay . . . That's some good news. . ."

Re "Anyways. . . where are we? Are we still in the mansion?"

z "I don’t know . . . I can’t remember leaving, I guess so . . ."

Re " K. . . Hmmm. . . well, Since we’re here, Maybe we should introduce ourselves?"

z " Sounds like a start . . . "

Re "Right, You go first! It’s a little. . . bit a pain coming up with an introduction. . ."

z " So you’re saying you’re too lazy to go first "

Re "Well, that's the simpler form how to say it, I guess."

Re "Wayyyyy too hard to say my name and Ultimate. . . takes time"

z "Alright, . . . well . . . I’m Isy Patel, the Ultimate DJ"

Re "Oh come onnn. . . Why does everyone have cooler Ultimates then mine. . ."

Re "Anyways. . . I’m Reno Bulgur, Ultimate Actor, somehow."

Is "Cool Ultimate, better than mine. . ."

Re "Ugh! You're worse than him! Stop being a liar!!! You have such a cooler Ultimate!"

Is "First of all whose ‘him’ and second all I do is play music at parties and crap."

Re "I can answer the second one, not the first."

Re " Making music and making it original is amazing! You get SOOOOO Famous for it, Also, This is a party, so I would love to hear your music!"

Is "T-Thanks . . . and I might play a song or two later if you want"

Re "WOOOOO! I love music!!! But. . . I can’t play music by myself. . ."

Is "I could teach you if you want, I wouldn’t mind"

Re "Sure, when we get out of here, but first, there are other people here, right? Roundabout. . . 10? I forgot."

Is "there’s 15 of us including me and you"

Re "Oops! That means 13 others, well, maybe we should go and. . . ya know, See them?"

Is "yeah"

Re "Right, where should we head first then?"

Is "I have no idea"

"Suddenly, My stomach started to rumble, I guess that chooses where to go."

Re ". . . Kitchen Maybe?"

Is "from the sound of your stomach, yes"

"I blushed from embarrassment, I knew I should’ve eaten breakfast. . . Guess I was too excited, But anyways, We should hurry."

#*So screen turns black and reappears in the kitchen*

"WOW!"

"There was so much food on the counter, Cakes, Cookies. . . And my favourite, Cherries!"

"I think I got too excited over the food that I started to drool. . ."

z "Ew, Your drooling, Keep your drool away from me, freak."

"Owch, I was just thinking of food. . ."

Re "Sorry, I’m just really hungry, that's all."

"I started to look at the cherries again, I think I got too distracted because the next second I had Cherries thrown at my face."

Re "W-what the-?!"

z "You seemed like you wanted them, so I gave them to you, simple enough for a lazy person like you?"

Is "You could’ve just left the cherries and told him he could have them, instead of throwing them at him"

z "Just being lazy like him, it's much more easier, And my style."

"Is he. . .  Mocking me?"

Re ". . .Don't mock me like that. . ."

z "Can you shut up I’m trying to read."

"I looked over to the girl who said that, Also, Who reads in a Kitchen? Cook book, sure, But not a normal book. . ."

Re "Maybe Um. . . not read in the kitchen then?"

z "Who are you to tell me what to do?"

"Two Emo Edgy teens. . . What am I meant to do. . ."

Re "Ummm. . . Edginess aside, Should we...  Introduce ourselves?"

z "I’ll go last, Since I'm not bothered to think what to say to you freaks."

"GEEZ! This guy is really getting on my nerves!"

z "It’s a no if you think I should go first."

Re "Already expected that, anyways. . ."

Re " I’m Reno Bulgur, Ultimate Actor, Somehow. . ."

z "Somehow? Geez, got it out of luck? Would make sense since your WAYYYYY too lazy to do things."

"You know what. . . this guy has to REALLY shut up."

Re "No, Not from luck, I just acted and somehow became the best, Still don't know why."

Re "I used to do it with my little brother, We kinda went separate ways though."

z "If I had a brother like you, I would leave you too."

"You don't even know me. . . how would you know?"

Is "Alright quit being rude it’s getting on my nerve!"

z "You telling me to shut up? Geez, what a low move."

z "You don't even know who I am!"

Re "Eh? Who are you again? I forgot."

z "Raven Blui, Ultimate Acrobatic-"

Ra "SHIT!"

z "Wow good job on getting fooled."

Ra "Atleast Im not a scaredy cat to let people know my name, Kira."

Ki "I DON’T EVEN KNOW YOU PEOPLE WHY WOULD I TELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION!"

Re "It’s. . . Just your name and Ultimate. . ."

Ra "See? I told you you're a scaredy cat."

Ki "Sigh . . . I’m Kira Yin, Ultimate Prison Breaker"

Re "Eh? I’ve heard of you before."

Ki "A lot of people have heard of me . . ."

Ra "Unlike me and the other lazy person."

Re "Please knock that off. . .I am famous. . ."

Ki "Anyway, who's that chick standing next to you?. . ."

Re "Chick? There's no chicken- Oh, You mean Isy?"

Ki "yeah stupid"

Re "I have an IQ of 170 thank you."

Ra "I'm pretty sure your missing a decimal point in there."

"Whatever you say, Raven. . ."

Re "Umm ignoring that, Introduce yourself Isy!"

Is " . . . Isy Patel, Ultimate DJ"

Ra ". . . you work together or something?"

Is "Like you would care"

Re " Ummm but the answer is No. . ."

Ra "So your dating then, right?"

"Wait. . . What? Why would he think that?"

Is "The hell no we’re not!"

Ra "Your not? Geez, You just worked so well together so I just thought that."

"Is he being nice or shoving it in my face that I don't have a girlfriend. . ."

Re "Thanks?"

Ra "I was being sarcastic, geez."

"Raven just got up and left, why does he have to be so. . ."

"Edgy?!"

Re ". . ."


Is ". . ."

Re "Should we. . . check the other places. . . around here?"

Ki "oh please do! I’m sick of hearing your annoying voices"

Re ". . . I'm sick of yours too, Lets go Isy."

Is "k . . ."

#*Screen turns back, and goes to halls*

Re ". . .Where should we go now?"

Is "Anywhere is fine . . ."

Re ". . . You alright?"

Is "Yeah, I’m fine . . ."

Re ". . . K, Maybe we should go to the bedroom?"

Is "Sure . . ."

". . . Did I just sound like a pervy old man?"

"Whatever, I should just hurry to the bedroom, Just in case anyone is there."

". . . I really gotta stop sounding like that."

#*So the screen fades outsides of the bedroom*

Re "Umm. . . before we enter, Let me. . . check inside."

Is "okay?"

"I peeked through the crack of the door, I was worried if we’d see anything. . . non-pg, But I saw something completely different."

#*fades into a picture of Chiharo stuffing something quickly into the wardrobe*

Re "W-w-what the-?"

Is "Reno? You okay?"

Re "Oh yeah. . . It's fine. . ."

"I stopped looking inside the room, and turned back to Isy"

Re "Lets just go in already. . ."

Is "k"

"I tried to forget what I saw and walked inside the bedroom to meet this strange person."

z "O-oh hi, did you see that, over there on the wall"

"The strange boy pointed to the wall, I looked where he was pointed but couldn’t see what he was talking about"

Re "Ummm. . . Where?"

z " oh I thought I saw something…"

Re "I do that a lot too, either that or I’m too lazy to find a good excuse to hide something"

z "I don't know what you would be meaning by that… anyways, I’m Chiharo Burny the Ultimate Manga Artist, you are?"

"Chiharo seems to be hiding something, I should probably ignore it for now. . . Better since It’s a pain having too much in my mind, at least I got his name."

Re "Oh, Im Reno Bulgur, Ultimate Actor, and this girl is Isy."

Ch "O-ok well I guess, nice to meet you? You wouldn't happen to know why I woke up on this bed would you?"

Re "Umm, No I don't, I woke up on the floor. . . And I don't think Isy knows either, right Isy?"

"I looked behind me, But I didn’t see Isy anywhere, did she stay outside?"

Re "Ummm. . . give me a minute."

"I walked out the room to find Isy."

Re "Isy?"

Is "Yeah?"


Re "Aren’t you meant to be in the bedroom?"

"I still sound so creepy, and pervy, I really gotta stop that."

Is "Oh sorry yeah I’m coming now"

"I returned to the bedroom to see. . . someone new? Where did Chiharo go?"

z "Oh, Hi! Who are you guys?"

Re "Ummm. . . I’m Reno Bulgur, Ultimate Actor."

z "Hi Reno, girl that can’t be bothered to introduce themself! I’m Carrots Bunny Ultimate Furry!"

Re ". . . Ummm. . ."

Ca "Are you being . . . Anti-Furry?"

"Carrots Eh? What a strange name. . . Is he. . . even Human? And what's An AntiFurry and Furry?"

Re "What’s. . . a furry?"

Ca " oh i get it, you don't even know what a furry is! We are a bunch of people who have a passion for dressing up as anthropomorphic animals, we go to furcons, meetups, and even talk online! I could go on all day but i can tell you're getting bored of me talking…"

"Who said I was bored? But that does explain a lot. . ."

Re "Oh, So its like cosplaying?"

Ca "Well I guess, but instead of cosplaying as anime characters we dress up as our own made fursona! I can tell by your face what you don't know what a fursona is but it’s basically just an animal persona!"

". . . He sure does like to talk a lot. . . I'm used to it though, he's just like my brother. . ."

Re "Ummm, Hey, I know this is random, but I have a question."

Re "Do you know about D-"

"Carrots quickly cut me off before I got to ask my question, I was looking forward to saying it too. . ."

Ca "If your asking where Chiharo went, he decided that he needed to get some lunch…"

Re "Lunch? It's already Lunch?!"

Is "Yeah"

"Isy pointed to the clock in the room, It was around 2pm, I'm not bothered to find the minutes, so it’ll do."

Ca "yeah um… I'm not very hungry so I'll leave you to it.. "

Re "K?"

"Isy and I left the bedroom to go to lunch, I really wanted to eat the cherries so it's a win win! Maybe everyone else went there too!"

#*Fades into the kitchen uwu*

"I entered the Kitchen to see around 10 other people here. I can recognize Raven and Kira, but the rest are new to me."

z "Two more people have entered, That is 12 people in total."

Re "Oh um, I’m just here for the food, so. . . you won't have to deal with me much."

Ra "Be quick then."

"I forgot the Edgy Emo lord was here. . . Now I have another excuse to leave, But first, cherry time"

"I went to grab some cherries while everyone talked to each other, Not like they would want to talk to me anyways."

"As I went to grab the cherries, Someone took the cherries right under my nose."

z "Hm? Hm? Did you want the cherries? Did you want the cherries?"

"Oh this guy, I remember him, But I never got his name, I should probably ask about that."

Re "Yeah, I do. . . Maybe we can share-"

z "I didn’t say I would give them would I?"

Re "H-huh?!"

"He started to eat the cherries right in front of me. What is wrong with this guy?! And who eats cherries to piss people off?!"

z "Mmmmm so tasty! So tasty! Anywho, Your wondering who I am right?"

Ju "I'm Justu Kotomi! Ultimate Hypnotist! Ultimate Hypnotist!"

Re "A-alright then Justu. . . Im. . . Reno Bulgur. . . U-ultimate Actor. . ."

'What the- Did I act out of character? Must be due to his Ultimate. . ."
