# The game starts here.

label start:

z "That's the last of us, correct?"

z "I'm pretty sure! If I remember, it said 15 people on the invite, right?"

"It did? I only remember that there was a party. . ."

"I checked the invite card one more time, guess they were right, It does say 15. . ."

"I must’ve forgotten it when I was asleep, can’t blame me though, I was the first one here."

"Talking about sleeping. . . I might as well take another nap, it’ll take another hour to be there, and it's not like anyone would want to talk to me anyways."

"My sight faded into black as I soon drifted into sleep. . ."

#*Wait 5 seconds*

"I felt a tap on my shoulder, maybe I should correct that, I felt almost 100 taps on my shoulder every second."

z "H-hey Umm, are you awake? We’re here! At the p - party!"

"I slowly opened my eyes to see someone in front of me."

z "Oh we are? AWESOME! I was waiting for hours!"

z "You were only asleep for 20 minutes."

z "Don't ruin the fun, Let's just get to the party!"

"Oh, I have just noticed something, I was a little forgetful and forgot to introduce myself."

"I am Reno Bulgur, the Ultimate Actor."

"Everyone here is also an Ultimate. . . But I fell asleep so I didn’t catch their Ultimates."

"Oh, By the way, If your wondering. . . Ultimates are special talents people can have when you're the best of  the best at what you do. . . I don't know how I got mine thought, I just do what I do."

"Oh, And before I forget anything else, I should run to the party, I'm falling behind!"

#*Footsteps to show running, also Screen fades black*

#*Screen fades into the front of the mansion*

Re "Wow. . . This is bigger than my house!"

z "No shit, Nobody here lives in a mansion."

Re "Hey. . . Thats rude."

z "That's the point"

z "Come on! Forget the bad things and let's go in already!"

z " Mhm! Mhm! Forget the bad! Forget the bad! Let's just go in!"

"Ummm. . . he sure likes repeating himself. . . but both of them are right, we should forget the bad things and worries."

"I prepare myself to see the inside of this mansion, hyping myself, preparing myself to open the door"

z "Hey! Hey! I'm opening the door! Everyone! Come on!"

Re ". . . okay then"

"Everyone crowded around the door while the strange small boy opened it."

"The door opened, and when we all got in suddenly. . ."

"*THUD*"

"The person who woke me up before fainted right then and there. . . everyone did one by one. . ."

"I quickly covered my nose and mouth, I saw a strange gas fill the room, now I couldn’t see anymore, the strange gas covered my sight, All I could see is. . . a shadow in the gas."

"It looked like a girl with cat ears for some reason. She uncovered my nose and I soon fainted into darkness."

#-Shows opening for prolog-

"I wake up to be in some kind of fancy living room, . . what happened. . . I can't remember anything. . ."

"I look where I am, Im. . . on the floor next to the couch. . . Geez, I must’ve fallen off again."

"I get up to look around, Just in case if someone else was here."

Re "Hello? Is. . . Anyone here?"

"I can barely see anything, wonder why, My eyes have never been this bad before."

"I can see a figure, I can't hear anything, I can't smell anything either . . . Did I get really drunk or something?"

"It does make sense if I can't remember anything then. . . And it's a party too, right?"

"I rub my eyes to see if I can fix my eyes or not. . . it doesn’t work though."

"I walk up to the figure to see if I can see them better, I can see them sightly, but I don’t think it's any good just knowing they are female."

"I think I’m also getting my senses back, I can sightly hear something."

z "Hey you alright, can you hear me?"

Re ". . . slightly, are you also having issues with your senses?"

z "yeah . . ."

Re " So i'm not drunk? Okay . . . That's some good news. . ."

Re "Anyways. . . where are we? Are we still in the mansion?"

z "I don’t know . . . I can’t remember leaving, I guess so . . ."

Re " K. . . Hmmm. . . well, Since we’re here, Maybe we should introduce ourselves?"

z " Sounds like a start . . . "

Re "Right, You go first! It’s a little. . . bit a pain coming up with an introduction. . ."

z " So you’re saying you’re too lazy to go first "

Re "Well, that's the simpler form how to say it, I guess."

Re "Wayyyyy too hard to say my name and Ultimate. . . takes time"

z "Alright, . . . well . . . I’m Isy Patel, the Ultimate DJ"

Re "Oh come onnn. . . Why does everyone have cooler Ultimates then mine. . ."

Re "Anyways. . . I’m Reno Bulgur, Ultimate Actor, somehow."

Is "Cool Ultimate, better than mine. . ."

Re "Ugh! You're worse than him! Stop being a liar!!! You have such a cooler Ultimate!"

Is "First of all whose ‘him’ and second all I do is play music at parties and crap."

Re "I can answer the second one, not the first."

Re " Making music and making it original is amazing! You get SOOOOO Famous for it, Also, This is a party, so I would love to hear your music!"

Is "T-Thanks . . . and I might play a song or two later if you want"

Re "WOOOOO! I love music!!! But. . . I can’t play music by myself. . ."

Is "I could teach you if you want, I wouldn’t mind"

Re "Sure, when we get out of here, but first, there are other people here, right? Roundabout. . . 10? I forgot."

Is "there’s 15 of us including me and you"

Re "Oops! That means 13 others, well, maybe we should go and. . . ya know, See them?"

Is "yeah"

Re "Right, where should we head first then?"

Is "I have no idea"

"Suddenly, My stomach started to rumble, I guess that chooses where to go."

Re ". . . Kitchen Maybe?"

Is "from the sound of your stomach, yes"

"I blushed from embarrassment, I knew I should’ve eaten breakfast. . . Guess I was too excited, But anyways, We should hurry."

#*So screen turns black and reappears in the kitchen*

"WOW!"

"There was so much food on the counter, Cakes, Cookies. . . And my favourite, Cherries!"

"I think I got too excited over the food that I started to drool. . ."

z "Ew, Your drooling, Keep your drool away from me, freak."

"Owch, I was just thinking of food. . ."

Re "Sorry, I’m just really hungry, that's all."

"I started to look at the cherries again, I think I got too distracted because the next second I had Cherries thrown at my face."

Re "W-what the-?!"

z "You seemed like you wanted them, so I gave them to you, simple enough for a lazy person like you?"

Is "You could’ve just left the cherries and told him he could have them, instead of throwing them at him"

z "Just being lazy like him, it's much more easier, And my style."

"Is he. . .  Mocking me?"

Re ". . .Don't mock me like that. . ."

z "Can you shut up I’m trying to read."

"I looked over to the girl who said that, Also, Who reads in a Kitchen? Cook book, sure, But not a normal book. . ."

Re "Maybe Um. . . not read in the kitchen then?"

z "Who are you to tell me what to do?"

"Two Emo Edgy teens. . . What am I meant to do. . ."

Re "Ummm. . . Edginess aside, Should we...  Introduce ourselves?"

z "I’ll go last, Since I'm not bothered to think what to say to you freaks."

"GEEZ! This guy is really getting on my nerves!"

z "It’s a no if you think I should go first."

Re "Already expected that, anyways. . ."

Re " I’m Reno Bulgur, Ultimate Actor, Somehow. . ."

z "Somehow? Geez, got it out of luck? Would make sense since your WAYYYYY too lazy to do things."

"You know what. . . this guy has to REALLY shut up."

Re "No, Not from luck, I just acted and somehow became the best, Still don't know why."

Re "I used to do it with my little brother, We kinda went separate ways though."

z "If I had a brother like you, I would leave you too."

"You don't even know me. . . how would you know?"

Is "Alright quit being rude it’s getting on my nerve!"

z "You telling me to shut up? Geez, what a low move."

z "You don't even know who I am!"

Re "Eh? Who are you again? I forgot."

z "Raven Blui, Ultimate Acrobatic-"

Ra "SHIT!"

z "Wow good job on getting fooled."

Ra "Atleast Im not a scaredy cat to let people know my name, Kira."

Ki "I DON’T EVEN KNOW YOU PEOPLE WHY WOULD I TELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION!"

Re "It’s. . . Just your name and Ultimate. . ."

Ra "See? I told you you're a scaredy cat."

Ki "Sigh . . . I’m Kira Yin, Ultimate Prison Breaker"

Re "Eh? I’ve heard of you before."

Ki "A lot of people have heard of me . . ."

Ra "Unlike me and the other lazy person."

Re "Please knock that off. . .I am famous. . ."

Ki "Anyway, who's that chick standing next to you?. . ."

Re "Chick? There's no chicken- Oh, You mean Isy?"

Ki "yeah stupid"

Re "I have an IQ of 170 thank you."

Ra "I'm pretty sure your missing a decimal point in there."

"Whatever you say, Raven. . ."

Re "Umm ignoring that, Introduce yourself Isy!"

Is " . . . Isy Patel, Ultimate DJ"

Ra ". . . you work together or something?"

Is "Like you would care"

Re " Ummm but the answer is No. . ."

Ra "So your dating then, right?"

"Wait. . . What? Why would he think that?"

Is "The hell no we’re not!"

Ra "Your not? Geez, You just worked so well together so I just thought that."

"Is he being nice or shoving it in my face that I don't have a girlfriend. . ."

Re "Thanks?"

Ra "I was being sarcastic, geez."

"Raven just got up and left, why does he have to be so. . ."

"Edgy?!"

Re ". . ."


Is ". . ."

Re "Should we. . . check the other places. . . around here?"

Ki "oh please do! I’m sick of hearing your annoying voices"

Re ". . . I'm sick of yours too, Lets go Isy."

Is "k . . ."

#*Screen turns back, and goes to halls*

Re ". . .Where should we go now?"

Is "Anywhere is fine . . ."

Re ". . . You alright?"

Is "Yeah, I’m fine . . ."

Re ". . . K, Maybe we should go to the bedroom?"

Is "Sure . . ."

". . . Did I just sound like a pervy old man?"

"Whatever, I should just hurry to the bedroom, Just in case anyone is there."

". . . I really gotta stop sounding like that."

#*So the screen fades outsides of the bedroom*

Re "Umm. . . before we enter, Let me. . . check inside."

Is "okay?"

"I peeked through the crack of the door, I was worried if we’d see anything. . . non-pg, But I saw something completely different."

#*fades into a picture of Chiharo stuffing something quickly into the wardrobe*

Re "W-w-what the-?"

Is "Reno? You okay?"

Re "Oh yeah. . . It's fine. . ."

"I stopped looking inside the room, and turned back to Isy"

Re "Lets just go in already. . ."

Is "k"

"I tried to forget what I saw and walked inside the bedroom to meet this strange person."

z "O-oh hi, did you see that, over there on the wall"

"The strange boy pointed to the wall, I looked where he was pointed but couldn’t see what he was talking about"

Re "Ummm. . . Where?"

z " oh I thought I saw something…"

Re "I do that a lot too, either that or I’m too lazy to find a good excuse to hide something"

z "I don't know what you would be meaning by that… anyways, I’m Chiharo Burny the Ultimate Manga Artist, you are?"

"Chiharo seems to be hiding something, I should probably ignore it for now. . . Better since It’s a pain having too much in my mind, at least I got his name."

Re "Oh, Im Reno Bulgur, Ultimate Actor, and this girl is Isy."

Ch "O-ok well I guess, nice to meet you? You wouldn't happen to know why I woke up on this bed would you?"

Re "Umm, No I don't, I woke up on the floor. . . And I don't think Isy knows either, right Isy?"

"I looked behind me, But I didn’t see Isy anywhere, did she stay outside?"

Re "Ummm. . . give me a minute."

"I walked out the room to find Isy."

Re "Isy?"

Is "Yeah?"


Re "Aren’t you meant to be in the bedroom?"

"I still sound so creepy, and pervy, I really gotta stop that."

Is "Oh sorry yeah I’m coming now"

"I returned to the bedroom to see. . . someone new? Where did Chiharo go?"

z "Oh, Hi! Who are you guys?"

Re "Ummm. . . I’m Reno Bulgur, Ultimate Actor."

z "Hi Reno, girl that can’t be bothered to introduce themself! I’m Carrots Bunny Ultimate Furry!"

Re ". . . Ummm. . ."

Ca "Are you being . . . Anti-Furry?"

"Carrots Eh? What a strange name. . . Is he. . . even Human? And what's An AntiFurry and Furry?"

Re "What’s. . . a furry?"

Ca " oh i get it, you don't even know what a furry is! We are a bunch of people who have a passion for dressing up as anthropomorphic animals, we go to furcons, meetups, and even talk online! I could go on all day but i can tell you're getting bored of me talking…"

"Who said I was bored? But that does explain a lot. . ."

Re "Oh, So its like cosplaying?"

Ca "Well I guess, but instead of cosplaying as anime characters we dress up as our own made fursona! I can tell by your face what you don't know what a fursona is but it’s basically just an animal persona!"

". . . He sure does like to talk a lot. . . I'm used to it though, he's just like my brother. . ."

Re "Ummm, Hey, I know this is random, but I have a question."

Re "Do you know about D-"

"Carrots quickly cut me off before I got to ask my question, I was looking forward to saying it too. . ."

Ca "If your asking where Chiharo went, he decided that he needed to get some lunch…"

Re "Lunch? It's already Lunch?!"

Is "Yeah"

"Isy pointed to the clock in the room, It was around 2pm, I'm not bothered to find the minutes, so it’ll do."

Ca "yeah um… I'm not very hungry so I'll leave you to it.. "

Re "K?"

"Isy and I left the bedroom to go to lunch, I really wanted to eat the cherries so it's a win win! Maybe everyone else went there too!"

#*Fades into the kitchen uwu*

"I entered the Kitchen to see around 10 other people here. I can recognize Raven and Kira, but the rest are new to me."

z "Two more people have entered, That is 12 people in total."

Re "Oh um, I’m just here for the food, so. . . you won't have to deal with me much."

Ra "Be quick then."

"I forgot the Edgy Emo lord was here. . . Now I have another excuse to leave, But first, cherry time"

"I went to grab some cherries while everyone talked to each other, Not like they would want to talk to me anyways."

"As I went to grab the cherries, Someone took the cherries right under my nose."

z "Hm? Hm? Did you want the cherries? Did you want the cherries?"

"Oh this guy, I remember him, But I never got his name, I should probably ask about that."

Re "Yeah, I do. . . Maybe we can share-"

z "I didn’t say I would give them would I?"

Re "H-huh?!"

"He started to eat the cherries right in front of me. What is wrong with this guy?! And who eats cherries to piss people off?!"

z "Mmmmm so tasty! So tasty! Anywho, Your wondering who I am right?"

Ju "I'm Justu Kotomi! Ultimate Hypnotist! Ultimate Hypnotist!"

Re "A-alright then Justu. . . Im. . . Reno Bulgur. . . U-ultimate Actor. . ."

"What the- Did I act out of character? Must be due to his Ultimate. . ."

Ju "No no, you didn’t act like that because of my ultimate, it's because you're scared of me!’"

"He smiled as if he was having the time of his life, I can't believe this guy! Wait I just noticed something-. . ."

Re "Wait. . . did you just. . . read my mind?"

Ju "No no! Reading expressions are easy! Easy to learn!"

Re ". . ."

"I should just leave. . . this guy might be dangerous. . ."

"I left to talk to the girl who I saw beforehand. This time, she's in the corner looking at everyone like one of those lonely people in a movie."

"When I got to her, She just stared at me, as if I just spat in her lunch and handed it back. . these people here are so weird. . ."

z ". . . do you need something?"

Re "Oh Um, not really, no."

z "Then dont talk to me."

Re ". . ."

"Well that went well, I’ve also noticed something. She's wearing some kind of clown mask, But it's been all scratched up, I wonder what happened. . ."

Re "Well. . . Sorry. . . but I do have a question."

z "What, answer fast."

R "Who are you?"

z ". . ."

Cy "Cyan Hibit, Ultimate Spy."

Ju "Ooooo! Danger girl! Danger girl!"

"WHAT THE- When did he get there?!"

Ju "I followed you, simple, Also, these Grapes are awesome! I bet the ultimate cook or maid made these!"

Re ". . . most likely, I didn’t catch anyone's ultimates here-"

Ju "I got them all, Just not yours and the blue haired girl, But i'm pretty sure her name is Hari!"

"Wait, if he knows all their Ultimates then maybe he can tell me some-"

Ju "IDIOT! I won't tell you, private stuff ya know!"

"Did he. . . just call me an Idiot?"

Re "I dont think its private, it's just their Ultimates, don't you agree cyan?"

"I turned around to see Cyan, But she wasn’t there, did she run off?"

Ju "Mhm! She ran off alright! Also by the way, I wanna make a deal!"

Re "A deal?"

Ju "If you can tell me that Blue chicks Ultimate, I’ll give you some Cherries!"

"Dang it! That's tempting! But I really want those cherries. . . Alright! Let's do this Reno!"

Re "Alright, deal, but I expect the best cherries!"

Ju "I wouldn’t ever give the bad cherries to a friend!"

"That's good news, I should hurry and get Hari’s Talent. Oh, and I wonder if Justu will tell me more of the Ultimates, that would make the deal fairer."

"I walked up to the strange girl with two blue pig tails- well, Pigtail buns. . . but still"

"I need those cherries. "

Re "Um, Hello, Your name is. . . Hari correct?"

z "Y-Yeah i-i-i-it i-is . . ."

"She's so scared, I wonder why. . . "

Re "Well nice to meet you Hari! Im Reno Bulgur! Ultimate Actor!"

Ha "n-nice t-to m-m-meet you t-too. . ."

Re "Do you. . . mind telling me your Ultimate?"


Ha "L-Like I told the other guy no . . ."

Ju "Heyyyy!!! Pleaseeeeee!! This guy needs his cherries!"

"This guy really likes following me. . ."

Ha "N-No m-means no . . ."

Re ". . . Justu can you. . . like. . . leave for a minute."

Ju "Aww. . . fine."

"Justu walked out of the Kitchen, I mean, I meant in the corner but that works too. . ."

"So I should take this chance to talk to her."

Re ". . . Are you scared?"

Ha ". . ."

Re ". . ."

Re "I won't hurt you, you know, I don't judge either."

Ha "Y-You won’t?"

Re "Of course! Judging people. . . or hurting people is just a pain to do. . . and I hate when people do that, I just think we should be happy with what we got!"

"I tried to cheer her up, she seems so. . . scared of everything, I could help her with that. . . when I get the energy."

Ha "W-Well I might a-as well i-introduce mys-self properly t-then . . ."

Ha "I’m Hari Yanio, Ultimate Planner"

Re "Oh! So an architect! That's pretty cool!"

Ha "T-Thanks . . ."

Re "No problem! I told you I don't judge, I mainly just sleep 24/7. . ."

Re "Anywho, why didn’t you want to tell Justu your ultimate?"

Ha "He w-was a bit rude b-before . . ."

"I should’ve expected that. . . He was rude to me too."

Re "Eh? What did he say?"

Ha "I’d rather n-not t-talk about i-it. . ."

"That rude eh. . . I don't wanna think of what he said. . . not just because it's rude, but because it hurts my head to think sometimes."

Re "Alright Hari, I should probably leave, Justu most likely is waiting for me, And if I remember, Isy is waiting outside too. . . I saw her leave. . ."

Ha "d-dont leave me here w-with Raven and Kira! . . ."

"Oh, right, the two edge lords are here, I should probably do something to help her. . ."

Re "How about you follow me then?"

Ha "s-sure . . . I-I just want to get a-away from t-the two . . ."

Re "Right! Lets go! I can't stand them anyways. . . such edge lords. . ."

"I left the kitchen with Hari following behind, To meet with Justu, Isy and some other girl."

Ju "Well, Well? What's the blue chicks talent? What is it, What is it?"

'Where does he get the energy. . ."

Re "Umm, Ultimate planner she said."

Ju ". . .huh, how interesting."

"He suddenly sounded like a fully grown man! What the heck!?"

Ju "Ultimate planner huh. . ."

Ju "That could help me a lot with my work! Wowie!"

"Now he was talking normal again, that does sound a lot better. . . I don't think him sounding like a grown man suits him.""

Ha "W-Why would I h-help you a-after what y-you said!"

Ju "Oh, when I called you a crybaby bitch? Oops! Didn’t mean to say that in the past! I was just thinking about someone I hate, Don't worry! It's not you!"

"HE CALLED HER A WHAT?!""

Ha "I-I’m s-still n-not helping y-you. . ."

Ju "fair enough, Hypnosis is a one person job anyways"

"Then why ask . . . that's just wasting breath. . .""

Ju "Anywho, There's a new chick for you to meet Reno! Me and your chick already talked to her, so it's now your turn to talk to her!"

"I'm just gonna ignore that statement, but there's a new girl I should meet, he says."

"I looked at the girl who was next to the strange small boy."

z "Good afternoon!"

"How formal. . ."

Re "Hello. . ."

Fi "I shall introduce myself, I am  Fiona Laceray, the Ultimate influencer."

"She's quick to the chase. . . I might as well follow."

Re "Umm. . . Reno Bulgur, Ultimate Actor.

"This feels. . . very awkward of how formal she is. . ."

Is "How are you so formal?"

Fi "Well, years of speaking like this, it was a part of me, so that would explain much."

Is "I guess so?"

Fi "By the way, May you please introduce yourself?"

"She was looking at Hari, this. . . is gonna take a long time."

Ha ". . . R-Reno can y-you do it f-for me . . ."

Re "Um sure, Her name is Hari Yanio, She's the ultimate Planner, But formally known as the ultimate architect."

Fi "What a wonderful Talent, Hari!"

Ha "Thank you . . ."

Fi "My pleasure."

Fi "Oh and by the way, If you do not mind, please call me Fi instead of my real name."

Fi "That's like me when I’m too lazy to put an O in my name."

Is "But Fiona is already a short name"

Re "Reno is a short name but I still have an Nickname."

Is "So I’m the only one that doesn’t have a Nickname?"

Re "I could call you Is, But then I'm just saying the word 'Is'"

Ju "So are we just gonna tell our nicknames?"

Ju "I'm called

"The little piece of shit the most!"

"That would make sense. . ."

Re "You're proud?"

Ju "Yup! Every single person who called me it has turned into my slave with my strong hypnosis powers!"

Ha "I highly doubt that ‘hypnosis’ is even real. . ."

Ju "Yeah, that's because the ways they do hypnosis in the movies is wrong.."

Ju "The round circle thingy in the movies isn’t how hypnosis is used, Its with colours, pictured, and flashes."

Ju "On each picture has a different effect, like how everyone has a favourite different colour! Fun fact, mine is hot pink!

Ha "Any kind of pink is gross to me . . ."

Ju "I don't like the colour itself, I like what it does to people."

Ju "Most of the time, It makes people act like chickens! That why i call girls Chicks a lot!"

Re "What do you mean most of the time. . . what happens when they dont act like chickens. . ."

Ju "Oh, they kill themselves, why?"

Is "WHAT THE HELL!?"

Ju "What? They don't do it straight away, it takes a day."

Ju "What happens is that they spend the day with their loved ones or doing something fun so they can remember that for when they are dead and die happily, That's why I like the colour!"

"Now that sounds a bit nicer. . ."

Re "That. .  . is a bit better then just Killing themselves"

Ju "Oops! I forgot to say that first!"

Ha ". . ."

Is ". . ."

Fi ". . . Just how do they kill themselves though."

Ju " A strange big monster strangles them! I don't know the details though. . ."

Ju "Anywho, Red makes people hungry, Blue makes them my slaves and green makes them into perverts!"

"Thats. . . Kinda gross."

Ha "ew"

Fi "I do not believe we needed the. . . Extra information."

Ju "Alright then! I'm glad I didn’t explain cyan then!"

"Oh no. ..  I'm worried about what my favourite colour does. . ."

Is "And please don’t explain it at all"

Ju "K!"

Ju "Well anywho, I should give the cherries and leave!"

"Justu handed- Well, more like shoved the cherries into my hands and ran off laughing his head off."

Ha "I-I don’t k-know if I-I-I s-should be scared o-of him o-or w-weirded out . . ."

Re "Or even trust him. . ."


"Maybe he's the one who made me not remember anything. . . it would make sense. ."

"Maybe. . . he. . . did the gas I slightly remember of?"

"I suddenly remembered what I saw, The strange girl figure with cat ears, I don't. . . remember  much, but I can still feel the fear I had."

"I started to tremble out of nowhere, I feel like something is off here. . . I feel. . . strange. . ."

Is "Reno! Are you ok?"

"I snapped out of my thoughts and looked at Isy"

Re "O-oh! Sorry. . . stuck in a thought, don’t worry about it."

Fi "Are you certain?"

Re ". . .y-yeah. . ."

"Nobody remembers it. . . nobody cares about it. . . Is it because. . . I defended myself?"

Is "Well . . . what now?"

Re "well. . . How about we look around more. . . how many people have we seen so far?"

Is "I lost tract"

"I started to count how many people we’ve seen."

"Kira. . . 1, Raven. . . 2, Justu. . .3, Hari. . . 4, Cyan. . . 5, Fiona. . . 6. . . Chiharo. . . 7, Carrots. . . 8."

"So 8 people so far. . . that means there's 5 others here."

Re "We’ve seen 8 people so far, so that means there's 5 other people."

Is "Well . . . let’s go!"

Fi "Alright, maybe we should split up so we can find them much faster?"

Re "Good idea."

Is "Who’s with who?"

Fi "Since you seem to work well together, the groups should be me and Hari, then you and Reno."

"Why does everyone pair us up together. . . we only just met. . . I mean, I guess I'm not compla-""

Fi "Now, shall we go off?"

Ha ". . ."

Fi "Do not worry Hari, I will protect you with my life!"

Ha "O-Ok . . ."

"I'm glad Fiona said that, I don't have to worry about Hari, Now I can just focus on meeting new people and talking to Isy. . . and planning my next nap. . ."

"I watched the two walk away, I have two questions I want to ask Isy now. . "

Re "Ummm. . .Isy, I have two questions. . ."

Is "Hmm?"

Re "First, do you know dic-. . . forget that one."

Re "Do you remember the Gas Attack?"

Is ". . . Not entirely but sorta"

Re ". . . When did you faint."

Is "Not too sure . . ."

Re ". . . Do you remember a female figure with cat ears in the gas."

Is "I remember the cat ears not the female part though . . ."

Re "Oh so you do too, maybe then you’d know the first question."

Re "Do you know about D.I.C.E?"

Is "No. . . should I know?"

Re ". . . No, forget it then."

Re "Just seeing if you know. . . what might happen."

Re ". . ."

"I started imagining it, what happened to him . . . all the blood-"

"Oh, Maybe I shouldn’t be thinking about that. .  . I don't want to cry in public again do I?"

"Even if I thought that, I started to cry, I couldn’t help myself, But I kept trying to keep a smile."

Is "R-Reno you ok!?"

Re "U-um yeah. . . im fine. . . "

"I wiped my tears and continued to smile."

Re "It’s silly of me to cry, Lets just continue walking."

Is "Yeah"

"We continued to walk until we came across a room with the door open."

Re "Huh? The door is open, maybe someone is in there!"

"I walked into the room to see a girl. . . coding an ipad in front of some strange dressed person"

Is ". . ."

Re "Umm. . .hello?"

z "Oh Tatum, l-look, People are h-here!"

Ta "wait… a sec"

Ta "ok you should be fine now D1T-T0"

Di "Is this a joke to that famous show I've heard about?"

"At Least I know their names now."

Re "Umm. . . well, Hello. . ."

Di "Hello! I-im D1T-T0! Though I r-r-rather be called Ditto without the numbers, And I'm the U-Ultimate Scientist, But a-also the Ultimate Program!"

Ta "I found him on the floor in the middle of the hallway and when I checked to see if he had a pulse I found out he was a malfunctioning program and a big chunk of his memory was corrupted”

Ta "so I used this my ipad to enter his hard drive and broke into his system using a program I developed to brute force……"

"I . . . Have NO Idea what she is saying, but all I know is that his memory was corrupted, maybe that has something to do with the gas."

Re "Ummm, so your the Ultimate Programmer or something-"

Ta "and it turns out he was forced to shut down and a piece of malware was injected into his system…”

"Did she just ignore me?"

Di "Ummm. . . Tatum, He asked you a question."

Ta "what?""

Re ". . . Can you. . . introduce yourself please? I think you forgot that."

Ta "oh, hello I'm Tatum the ultimate developer”

Re ". . . Reno Bulgur, Ultimate actor."

Di "Oh! Oh! I know you! If I remember you- OW!"

"Ditto quickly held his head, he seemed to be in some kind of pain, maybe it had something to do with the corrupt file?"

Ta "I told you try not to delve memories until tomorrow I haven't fully repaired your indexing system and you still have some holes in your memories ”

Is ". . ."

Di "R-right sorry. . ."

". . . this. . . is going to take some time to get used to."

"But at least I’ve got information. Maybe Ditto wasn’t affected by the gas, and saw the figure I saw."

Re "Hey Ditto, if you can remember, Do you remember the gas?"

Di ". . . Gas? What gas? I don't remember any gas."

Re ". . . Oh alright."

"That. . . didn’t help."

Is ". . ."

Re "Well, We should head off, right Isy?"

"Is just nodded to me, I quickly nodded back and walked out of the room.""

Re ". . ."

Re "Should we continue our search?"

"She just nodded again, is something wrong?"

Re ". . . Is something wrong?"

Is "No I just don’t feel like talking a lot now . . ."

"I know im lazy with my excuses, but that's just SUPER LAZY"

Re "whatever you say. . ."

"We continued to walk, it. . . was very awkward not talking. . ."

"But, at the end of that, we found a room with another door open, maybe there's more people there!"

"I walked into the room, hoping not to find anymore broken Programs or devs. . ."

z "Look! There's a new person!"

z ". . . u-u-umm. . . well then. . . w-w-we should introduce ourselves r-r-right??"

I "I guess . . ."

Mi ". . . I-i am M-m-misuki Galaxy, T-the Ultimate Spell caster. . ."

Ry "And Im Ryu Ganile! The Ultimate Constructor! Nice to meet ya!"

Re "Oh, Nice to meet you two, I'm Reno Bulgur, The Ultimate actor."

Re "And this is Isy, The Ultimate Dj!"

Ry "A Dj? I could make a portable DJ stand if she wants. . . Only if I had the materials. . ."

Re "I know what you mean, It sucks not able to do the things you want to do."

Re "Oh, By the way, can you really do spells Misuki?"

Mi "O-o-only when I-Im focused. . ."

"That kinda sucks. . . I’ve always wanted to see magic, like from the magic movie I know where they do floating spells! I wanna be in red team. . ."

"Anyways. . . we better go meet back up with Fiona and Hari, They might have found the other person"

Re "Hey, Isy, should we leave and meet back up with Hari and Fiona at the dining hall?"

"She just nodded again, Something IS wrong."

Re "Right. . . Well, See you later!"

"We walked off to the dining hall in the Kitchen that I saw before, I’ve noticed that Raven and Kira weren't there anymore."

"And as I noticed that, Hari and Fiona came in."

Fi "Oh, You have bet us to it."

Re "Uhh, seems like it."

"I looked at Hari, And then see-"

"She's been hurt!"

Re "Oh my goodness are you okay?!"

Ha "I-I’m o-okay . . . just a few from what I normally get . . ."

Re ". . ."

"Just like. .. how I was, I used to get bullied for liking drama so much even if im a boy, its like that all boys need to love sports or whatever. So I guess I can feel her, I used to say that too."

Re "Do you need help with those cuts though?"

Ha "Y-Yes please . . ."

"I went to the Kitchen and grabbed a first aid-kit and went back to Hari."

"I started to tend the wounds she had gained, I bet the edge lords did this."

Re "That better?"
